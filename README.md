# Satellite-Imagery
This is deep learning project for the satellite images. 

This is divided into three parts:

1. Data Processing for the Satellite Imagery
- Data Preparation
- Satellite Data Processing
  
2. Deep Learning with Satellite Image Data
- Deep Learning Model Training
- Local Debugging
- Prediction with model performance
  
3. Advance Deep Learning with Satellite Image Data
-  Remote debugging with Weights & Biases
- Model Saving and Reloading with custom metrics and loss function 
- Activation/Gradients outputs with heatmap, 
- Model Deployment application and Model Serving app on Hugging Face

  ## Content: 
  The dataset consists of aerial imagery of Dubai obtained by MBRSC satellites and annotated with pixel-wise semantic segmentation in 6 classes. The total volume of the dataset is 72 images grouped into 6 larger tiles. The 
  classes are:
  - Building: #3C1098
  - Land (unpaved area): #8429F6
  - Road: #6EC1E4
  - Vegetation: #FEDD3A
  - Water: #E2A929
