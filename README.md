# Satellite-Imagery
This is deep learning project for the satellite images. 

This is divided into three parts:

1. Data Processing for the Satellite Imagery
- Data Preparation
- Satellite Data Processing
  
2. Deep Learning with Satellite Image Data
- Deep Learning Model Training
- Local Debugging
- Prediction with model performance
  
3. Advance Deep Learning with Satellite Image Data
-  Remote debugging with Weights & Biases
- Model Saving and Reloading with custom metrics and loss function 
- Activation/Gradients outputs with heatmap, 
- Model Deployment application and Model Serving app on Hugging Face
